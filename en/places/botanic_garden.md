## Montserrat Botanic Garden

The **Montserrat National Trust Botanical Gardens**, located in **Olveston**, are a vital hub for **conservation**, **education**, and **community engagement**. Established in **2005** through collaboration between the Montserrat National Trust (MNT) and partners including the **Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew**, the gardens were developed to replace the original botanical gardens in **Plymouth**, which were lost during the volcanic crisis of the 1990s. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Today, the gardens provide a welcoming space for residents and visitors, while supporting conservation and research focused on Montserrat’s native and endemic flora.

## Montserrat’s National Herbarium and digitisation

Recent work includes the development of **Montserrat’s National Herbarium**, hosted by the Montserrat National Trust. This herbarium is a key resource for botanical research and conservation, providing a repository for plant specimens collected across Montserrat’s ecosystems.

The Trust is also advancing the **digitisation of its collections**, aiming to make specimen records and images accessible online. A digital herbarium supports research, education, and evidence-based conservation by improving access to botanical information and strengthening biodiversity data systems.
