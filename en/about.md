description: Montserrat is a small volcanic island in the Caribbean, known for its lush tropical forests, dramatic landscapes, and exceptional biodiversity. Despite its limited size, it supports a remarkable variety of plant and animal species, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. The island’s ecosystems—from sandy beaches to montane rainforests—harbour unique flora and fauna that have adapted to its rugged terrain and periodic volcanic activity, making Montserrat a vital refuge for Caribbean biodiversity.

## About The Portal

Welcome to the Montserrat Biodiversity Data Portal—your gateway to discovering the rich and unique biodiversity of the island.

This platform brings together data from scientists, conservationists, government agencies, and community members to showcase Montserrat’s living natural heritage. 

Biodiversity data for Montserrat remains limited, and with many areas still under-surveyed, it is likely that species new to science, especially among, invertebrates, and fungi, are yet to be discovered; improving data access through this portal directly supports the United Nation’s Convention on Biological Diversity Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) targets on monitoring, species conservation, and equitable knowledge sharing and the Sustainable Development Goals which aim for “ peace and prosperity for people and the planet”.

From endemic species like the Montserrat oriole and the galliwasp lizard, to native plants and pollinators recorded by both professionals and citizen scientists, the portal helps us better understand, protect, and celebrate the biodiversity that makes Montserrat so special.

## Why this matters
Montserrat is located in the Leeward Islands in the Eastern Caribbean. With unique habitats such as the Centre Hills Protected Area, regenerating volcanic landscapes, and coastal ecosystems, the island supports rare and threatened species found nowhere else on Earth.

This globalyl important biodiversity faces threats from habitat change, invasive species, and climate impacts. This portal helps address data gaps by improving access to biodiversity data for research, conservation action, environmental education, and informed decision-making.

## What you’ll find here
* Species records from Montserrat, including birds, plants, invertebrates, fungi, and marine life
* Data from surveys where openly available.
* Data from citizen science platforms such as iNaturalist and local monitoring efforts like the Flower-Insect Timed (FIT) Count
* Resources for educators, students, and nature enthusiasts
* Links to local trails, biodiversity guides, and how to get involved

## Get involved
Everyone can contribute to this portal! Whether you're a researcher, a student, or a nature-loving hiker, your wildlife sightings matter. Download the iNaturalist app, take part in a local monitoring event, or join a guided hike—and help build Montserrat’s biodiversity record for future generations.
