Key components included:

- **Ecological and socioeconomic data collection** to support management planning  
- **Monitoring and research**, including vegetation plots and biodiversity surveys  
- **Capacity building and education**, supporting community involvement in conservation and sustainable land management  

The Centre Hills Protected Area continues to play a vital role in the conservation of Montserrat’s ecosystems. Ongoing efforts to protect and restore habitat, monitor wildlife populations, and engage local communities are essential for preserving the island’s biodiversity for future generations.
