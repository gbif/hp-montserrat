## Hiking Trails of Montserrat: A Gateway to Nature and Discovery

Montserrat’s hiking trails wind through striking volcanic landscapes, lush forests, and coastal viewpoints. They offer not only a chance to connect with nature, but also to support **personal health and well-being**. Walking in green spaces can reduce stress, boost mood, and support physical fitness — whether you are taking a gentle stroll or a more challenging hike.

## Be a citizen scientist on the trails

While enjoying the trails, hikers can contribute to biodiversity monitoring by recording wildlife and plants through citizen science tools. These simple activities help scientists, land managers, and the Montserrat community build a better understanding of the island’s ecosystems.

Even a single observation — a butterfly, bird, lizard, or native plant — can contribute valuable information.

### Record wildlife with iNaturalist
Use **iNaturalist** to upload observations with photos and locations. The online community can help confirm identifications, and records can contribute to conservation and research.

### Take part in a FIT Count
The **Flower-Insect Timed Count (FIT Count)** is a simple 10-minute survey recording insects visiting a patch of flowers. It helps track pollinator activity and supports conservation.
