## Data Portal Projects

Accessing conservation funding in the UK Overseas Territories (UKOTs), including on Montserrat, presents significant challenges due to their unique constitutional status. The UKOTs are neither fully part of the UK nor independent states, meaning they are often **ineligible for major international funding sources** such as the **Global Environment Facility** and the **EU LIFE Fund**.

As a result, UKOTs rely heavily on **UK-based funding streams**, particularly **Darwin Plus**, as well as a small number of philanthropic funders (such as the **John Ellerman Foundation**) who have supported targeted UKOT-focused initiatives.

## Darwin Plus Projects on Montserrat

The UK Government’s **Darwin Plus** programme has been instrumental in supporting biodiversity conservation on Montserrat. Darwin Plus began in **2012**, following earlier UK Government support through the Overseas Territories Environment Programme (OTEP) and Darwin Initiative funding streams.

Since 2012, Montserrat has received **over £4.24 million** in support across **24 projects** focused on protecting the island’s ecosystems, strengthening local conservation capacity, and conserving threatened species. These projects have included:

- restoration of the **critically endangered mountain chicken frog (*Leptodactylus fallax*)**
- development of **marine conservation strategies**
- coral restoration and monitoring programmes  
- community engagement, education, and youth involvement in conservation

Darwin Plus projects typically involve partnerships with local organisations such as the **Montserrat National Trust (MNT)** and the **Government of Montserrat**, strengthening local expertise and long-term sustainability.
