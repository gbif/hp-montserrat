## The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species

The **IUCN Red List of Threatened Species** is one of the most widely used global tools for biodiversity conservation. It provides a scientific framework for assessing a species’ **risk of extinction**, based on evidence such as population trends, geographic range, and threats. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

Species are placed into categories ranging from **Least Concern** through **Vulnerable**, **Endangered**, and **Critically Endangered**, to **Extinct**. These assessments help guide conservation planning, policy decisions, and funding priorities worldwide. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## The Montserrat oriole: a conservation success story

The **Montserrat oriole (*Icterus oberi*)** is endemic to Montserrat and is the island’s national bird. During the volcanic crisis of the 1990s and early 2000s, habitat loss and population decline led to the species being listed as **Critically Endangered**. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

Through dedicated conservation efforts and sustained monitoring, the species’ status has improved. The Montserrat oriole is now listed as **Vulnerable** on the IUCN Red List (most recently assessed in **2024**), reflecting the positive impact of conservation action and improved understanding of its population trends. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

Monitoring methods such as point counts and nest surveys have been essential for tracking these trends and supporting evidence-based reassessments.

## Why Red Listing matters for Montserrat

The Montserrat oriole remains vulnerable because it has a **very limited range** and faces ongoing threats from habitat degradation and invasive species. Continued monitoring and habitat management are essential for its long-term survival. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

Beyond the oriole, Red Listing is critically important for many other species on Montserrat — particularly **plants, invertebrates, and reptiles**, which are often less studied. By systematically assessing extinction risk, Red Listing can:

- highlight species that may be declining unnoticed  
- prioritise research and monitoring  
- guide habitat protection and invasive species management  
- support strategic allocation of limited conservation resources  
- strengthen awareness among policymakers, local communities, and international funders  

This helps ensure conservation action is **proactive rather than reactive**, and supports long-term ecological resilience.

## Linking Red List work with GBIF

Red Listing is closely linked to biodiversity data and research. The **Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)** provides open access to species occurrence records and is widely used in conservation and extinction risk assessments. GBIF also supports searching occurrence data by **IUCN Red List category**, reflecting the growing alignment between these global systems. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

By sharing occurrence records, population monitoring data, and distribution information through GBIF, Montserrat’s conservation community helps ensure that even lesser-known or endemic species are represented in global biodiversity databases. This improves visibility, supports evidence-based planning, and can strengthen opportunities for research collaboration and conservation funding.

## Summary

The IUCN Red List provides a vital framework for assessing extinction risk and guiding conservation priorities. The recovery of the Montserrat oriole demonstrates how monitoring, partnership-based action, and scientific assessment can lead to meaningful improvements in conservation status — while underscoring the importance of continued efforts to safeguard Montserrat’s unique biodiversity.
